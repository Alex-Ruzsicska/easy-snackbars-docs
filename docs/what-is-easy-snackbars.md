# What is Easy Snackbars?

Welcome to Easy Snackbars, a versatile React and React Native library designed to simplify the implementation of snackbars (or toasts) within your application. With Easy Snackbars, you can swiftly integrate snackbars into your project using a combination of a SnackbarsProvider (React context) and a convenient displaySnackbar function.

At its core, Easy Snackbars offers a default snack component and various exhibition modes such as error, success, and info. However, what sets it apart is its complete customizability. Whether you prefer to utilize your custom components or integrate snackbars from other libraries, Easy Snackbars provides a seamless solution.

If you're eager to get started, head straight to the Getting Started section. Installing the library, wrapping your app with the provider, and calling "displaySnackbar" is all it takes to begin enjoying simple snacks in your project.

For a deeper dive into the API, explore the comprehensive documentation in the API section. Here, you'll find detailed information on the provider component props and display function parameters.

Ready to take customization to the next level? Discover how to create new snack modes, expand upon the default ones (such as success, error, warning, and info), or replace the library's default Snackbar component with your own. Check out the Custom Snackbar Components and Creating New Snackbar Modes sections for a step-by-step guide.
